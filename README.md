The Raspberry Pi Pico W is programmed to function as a node that gets data from a sensor. It then calculates the data quality dimensions, including precision, accuracy, completeness, concordance, and uncertainty. The DF and Nova data are fused using plausibility, and the DQ_Index is calculated. Then, sensor sends values using MQTT protocol to the Border Gateway (Raspberry Pi 4) to evaluate the values looking for Outliers using an Autoecoder (TensorFlor Lite Micro).
